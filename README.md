# Tsuna Excel Sorting App

This repository contains a command line tool to load an Excel file and sort its
contents by a chosen column while keeping the first column in its original order.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12 or higher
- `pandas` and `openpyxl` packages

Install the required packages with:

```bash
pip install pandas openpyxl
```

## Usage

```bash
python excel_sort.py path/to/file.xlsx --column COLUMN_NAME --output sorted.xlsx
```

The script sorts data by `COLUMN_NAME` while leaving the first column unchanged.
Sorting by the first column is not supported. If an output file is provided,
cells in columns other than the first that change position after sorting are
highlighted in yellowâ€“green. If `--output` is omitted, the sorted data will be
printed to the console.

## Grep network directory

The repository also includes a small utility to search for matching lines in
text files under a directory (for example, on a network share). Results are
written to a file, which defaults to `grep_out.txt`.

```bash
python grep_network.py DIRECTORY PATTERN --output results.txt
```
